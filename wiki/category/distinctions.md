Most system failures are not caused by missing technology, but by blurred concepts.

The **Distinctions** section separates ideas that are often treated as interchangeable — and shows why that confusion leads to architectural weakness.

These articles clarify differences such as:

- logging versus audit trails
- events versus intervals
- reconstruction versus observation
- data availability versus trustworthiness

Each distinction sharpens how systems should be designed, validated, and evaluated.

These texts are intentionally precise. They are meant to be referenced, quoted, and reused when explaining why "having the data" is not the same as understanding or trusting it.
