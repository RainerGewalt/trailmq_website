This section lays the groundwork for everything that follows.

The articles in **Foundations** focus on the underlying principles that make industrial systems trustworthy, explainable, and scalable — long before specific technologies or tools are discussed.

Here, GMP is treated not as a checklist, but as a way of thinking about time, responsibility, and system behavior. Trust is not assumed. It is designed.

You will find perspectives on:

- why GMP is fundamentally shaped by time and proximity
- why trust cannot be automated after the fact
- what regulated industries like Pharma teach about digital systems
- what it actually means for IIoT systems to be AI-ready

These articles answer **why** certain architectural constraints exist — and why ignoring them leads to fragile automation and stalled AI initiatives.
