The **Models** section introduces ways of thinking that can be applied to real systems.

These are not implementation patterns or product architectures. They are mental models that help structure complexity.

Topics include:

- how GMP scales with proximity to the physical process
- why decisions must be treated as first-class architectural elements
- why context alignment is the hardest problem in Industrial AI
- what operational twins really are — and what they are not

These models help bridge IT, OT, data engineering, compliance, and AI into a single, coherent architectural view.
