# About TrailMQ

TrailMQ is an **audit-first MQTT platform** designed for regulated industries where
communication must be **provable, traceable and reviewable** — not just fast.

It was created to bridge the gap between **machine-level messaging** and the
requirements of **GMP, GxP and regulated manufacturing environments**.

---

## Why TrailMQ exists

Standard MQTT brokers are optimized for throughput and simplicity.
In regulated environments, this is not enough.

Quality assurance, validation teams and auditors need answers to questions like:

- *What exactly happened?*
- *In which order?*
- *Who sent what, and under which policy?*
- *Was anything lost, modified or blocked?*

TrailMQ exists to make these questions **technically answerable**.

## Audit-first, not audit-later

TrailMQ treats auditability as a **core design principle**, not an afterthought.

Instead of relying on log files and external tooling, TrailMQ embeds:

- Policy-driven enforcement
- Hash-chained audit trails
- Retention and sequencing rules
- Explicit violation handling

directly into the messaging layer.

---

## Built for regulated environments

TrailMQ is designed to **support validated systems**, not to replace validation
processes or claim certifications.

It provides **audit-ready technical evidence** that can be used within existing
quality, validation and compliance frameworks.

TrailMQ supports workflows aligned with:
- GMP / G
