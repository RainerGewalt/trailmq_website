## Intervals are not abstractions – they are commitments

An interval is not just a time window.

It is a commitment.

A commitment to:

* what is included
* what is excluded
* and what can be compared

## Why intervals define meaning

Most industrial analysis happens over intervals.

Batches.
Recipe phases.
Campaigns.
Shifts.

If the interval is wrong, everything built on top of it is misleading.

Frequency, aggregation, and statistics only make sense *after* the interval is correct.

## Interval choice is an architectural decision

Choosing an interval defines:

* which events matter
* which signals are relevant
* and which conclusions are allowed

That choice cannot be postponed to analytics.

It must be made where process knowledge exists.

[As proximity increases, interval choice becomes critical](/wiki/gmp-proximity/).
