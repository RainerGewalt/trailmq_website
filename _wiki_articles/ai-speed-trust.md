## AI speed versus regulatory trust

AI innovation is accelerating globally.

But speed alone does not create trust.

In regulated environments, every inference must remain traceable.
Every dataset must be auditable.
Every output must be explainable.

## Bridging two worlds

The future requires architectures that support:

* continuous learning
* continuous compliance

Innovation without integrity is acceleration without direction.
