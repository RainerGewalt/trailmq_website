## Logs are not audit trails

Logs record events.
Audit trails prove integrity.

A real audit trail guarantees:

* immutability
* precise time ordering
* tamper evidence
* standardized, inspectable exports

Without these properties, compliance collapses under inspection.

Audit trails are not optional.
They are the backbone of regulatory trust.
