## Why dashboards do not create trust

Dashboards show what is happening.

Trust requires knowing why it happened.

---

## Visibility is not accountability

Real-time views look reassuring.
Alerts feel responsive.

But when results are questioned later, dashboards disappear.

Only architecture remains.

---

## Trust is retrospective by nature

Trust is tested after the fact.

When something goes wrong.
When decisions are challenged.
When responsibility must be assigned.

Dashboards optimize for now.
Trust optimizes for later.
