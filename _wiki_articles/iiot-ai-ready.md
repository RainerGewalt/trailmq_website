## What makes IIoT systems AI ready

Most systems are not AI ready.

Not because they lack models,
but because they lack trustable data foundations.

AI readiness requires:

* structured data flow
* traceable transformations
* validated interpretation logic
* auditable model inputs and outputs

AI is not a layer you add.
It is a capability your system earns.
