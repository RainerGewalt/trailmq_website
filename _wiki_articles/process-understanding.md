## AI is not the solution when the process is not understood

AI fails long before the model.

If a factory cannot answer:

* what happened
* when it happened
* in which recipe phase
* and how it compares to previous cycles

then AI has nothing to work with.

## Where real improvements come from

The strongest gains in Industrial AI rarely come from complex models.

They come from:

* comparing the same phase across batches
* detecting slow drifts over long windows
* aligning late or asynchronous signals correctly

These approaches outperform deep learning when clarity exists.

AI becomes powerful only on a solid foundation.
