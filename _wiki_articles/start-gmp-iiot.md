## How to start with GMP in IIoT projects

Many teams start building before defining what is GMP relevant.

A better approach:

* trace one data flow
* from sensor or PLC
* to storage or visualization

Document who touches it.
Document how it can change.

If one path is provably trustworthy,
most GMP principles are already understood.
