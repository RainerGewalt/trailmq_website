## We can't automate trust

We keep automating data, but not trust.

Systems communicate faster, pipelines grow smarter, yet no one can say with certainty:

* where data came from
* who changed it
* or whether it is still valid

This is not a tooling problem.
It is a communication problem.

## Why trust must be architectural

When trust is not embedded in communication, every automation step multiplies uncertainty.

AI cannot be more trustworthy than the data it consumes.

[Auditability is not created by collecting logs](/wiki/audit-is-not-logging/).

Industry 5.0 will not be defined by faster automation.
It will be defined by systems that can be trusted.
