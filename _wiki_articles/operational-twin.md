## Operational twins are about translation, not visualization

Most discussions about digital twins focus on visualization.

Dashboards.
3D models.
Animations.

That misses the point.

## Translation is the core function

An operational twin translates physical reality into:

* process intervals
* comparable states
* aligned sequences

The same physical process can be:

* explored interactively
* validated retrospectively
* automated safely

By changing the translation layer, not the underlying data.

## Why this matters for scale

Without translation, history cannot be reused.

Without reuse, learning stalls.

Operational twins make learning cumulative instead of episodic.
